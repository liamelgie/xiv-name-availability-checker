# XIV Name Availability Checker
A tool to check whether a character name is available across all worlds with a single search. A much easier and faster option than using the official FFXIV Lodestone to check each world individually.

You can access the tool [here](https://xiv-name-availability-checker.vercel.app/) or clone this repo and host it yourself.
